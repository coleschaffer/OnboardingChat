❯ You just pushed to Github but Railway didn't reply. Why is this? 

⏺ Let me check the Railway deployment status to see what's happening.

⏺ Bash(railway status 2>&1)
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 1

⏺ You're logged into Railway but this local directory isn't linked to a Railway
  project. Let me check your Railway projects.

⏺ Bash(railway status 2>&1)
  ⎿  Project: OnboardingChat
     Environment: production
     Service: None

⏺ The issue is that no service is linked locally. Let me check the services in
  this project.

⏺ Bash(railway service 2>&1)
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 1
     Failed to prompt for options

     Caused by:
         The input device is not a TTY

⏺ Bash(railway logs --limit 10 2>&1 || echo "No service selected")
  ⎿  error: unexpected argument '--limit' found

       tip: to pass '--limit' as a value, use '-- --limit'

⏺ Bash(railway open 2>&1 &)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ I opened the Railway dashboard in your browser. A few common reasons Railway
  might not auto-deploy after a GitHub push:

  1. No GitHub integration - The Railway project may not be connected to your
  GitHub repo. Check Settings → Source in the Railway dashboard.
  2. Auto-deploy disabled - Even with GitHub connected, auto-deploy might be
  turned off. Look for "Automatic Deployments" toggle in the service settings.
  3. Wrong branch - Railway might be watching a different branch than the one
  you pushed to.
  4. Service not configured - The project exists but may not have a service set
  up that's linked to your repo.

  Check the Railway dashboard that just opened and look at the service settings
  to verify the GitHub connection is active and auto-deploy is enabled for your
  main branch.

❯ It's enabled for Main branch, github is hooked up, auto deploy is on. Can 
   you ues Railway CLI to depoy changes?

  delayed welcomes. The new deployment should roll out shortly.
